MediVault

🚀 Inspiration
Managing medical records is often scattered, paper-based, and not easily accessible during emergencies or while switching doctors. We were inspired to create MediVault to give patients full control over their health data in one unified, secure, and shareable digital platform. Our goal: simplify access to healthcare information—anytime, anywhere.

💡 What it does
MediVault is a secure, user-friendly web app that allows patients to:

Store, view, and update their medical records
Share records via secure QR codes
Search & filter medical history
All within a modern, mobile-friendly interface.

🛠 How we built it
Frontend: Built using Bolt AI generated React components with Tailwind CSS for responsiveness and style
Backend: Powered by Supabase for authentication, database, and file storage
QR Code Sharing: Enabled secure, private sharing of individual records

🧱 Challenges we ran into
Integrating Map API was not possible because of prompt issues
Implementing dark mode was difficult
Balancing functionality and design to maintain a clean user experience
Keeping the database scalable and secure for future use cases
Doctor and hospital registration page and features were not build because of less credits

🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of
Built a complete app using only AI-generated code
Achieved a polished, responsive and modern UI
Integrated QR-based record sharing
Implemented profile management and real-time data updates

📚 What we learned
